## Color Scheme Generator

### Overview

This project was built while learning to work with JavaScript APIs in Scrimba's Frontned Career Path course. The project uses Color API to generate scheme limiting to 5 or 8 colors. The app sends a seed color along with a scheme mode
to the Color API and shows the returned colors. The Figma mockup was provided by Scrimba and the app was built entirely from scratch by me.

### Solo Project Challenge

####  Requirements

- Choose "seed color" with an `<input type="color" />`.
- Choose a color scheme mode in a `<select>` box.
- Clicking a button makes request to [The Color API]((https://www.thecolorapi.com) to get a color scheme.
- Display the scheme colors and hex values on the page.

#### Stretch Goals
- Click hex values or color bar to copy to clipboard.

### Learnings

This was a great project to get hands-on experience working with APIs, and Promises. A hands on experience with DOM manipulation and animations. It was a pleasure using grid layout which often times is tricky to 
apply. The project can be improved by implementing responsive layout and randomly adding color options rather than hard-coding them.

Much Gratitude to Scrimba Mentors and Code Reviewers for their guidance on this project and Frontend Development Path in general
